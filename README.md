# SMU University Curriculum Application

## About

This web application was made during my sophomore year of college, when my background was still primarily in web design. A collaboration with another student, this app was designed to help SMU students know what university credits they needed to fulfill.

Unfortunately, this app never made it into production. Still, it was my first attempt at material design and one of my best uses of jQuery. There's no bootstrap here - I wrote most of the CSS and JavaScript myself. 

The code in this repo is all static HTML and serves merely as a proof of concept. I recommend you open it in Chrome or Firefox.
